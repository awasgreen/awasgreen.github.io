Tracking human activity in real time and at fine spatial scale is particularly valuable during episodes such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, we discuss the suitability of smartphone data for quantifying movement and social contact. These data cover broad sections of the US population and exhibit pre-pandemic patterns similar to conventional survey data. We develop and make publicly available a location exposure index that summarizes county-to-county movements and a device exposure index that quantifies social contact within venues. We also investigate the reliability of smartphone movement data during the pandemic.

## Working Papers

### Demographic Preferences and Income Segregation
(with [Victor Couture](http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/couture/), [Jonathan Dingel](http://jdingel.com), [Jessie Handbury](http://jessiehandbury.com))

We investigate whether demographic preferences explain income segregation in shared spaces. To distinguish preferences over venues' demographic composition from preferences for other venue characteristics, we study venue choices within business chains.

## Works in Progress

### Peer Effects and Geographic Mobility: Evidence from U.S. Navy Servicemen during World War II
**Job Market Paper**

This paper studies how the expansion of network connections through Navy service during World War II shaped the economic landscape of the United States by influencing geographic mobility patterns. Utilizing a novel dataset of over one million servicemen, I investigate how quasi-random assignment to ships with varying geographic and ethnic composition of peers affected cross-state migration. I find that an increase in out-of-state peers markedly increases the probability of cross-state migration over a person's lifetime. This effect is largely driven by individuals moving to the states of shipmates they served with, suggesting that social ties formed during service played a significant role in migration decisions. However, ethnic differences are found to reduce the likelihood of migration highlighting how group differences can act as barriers to establishing network ties.

### Municipal Annexation, Local Public Goods, and Spatial Sorting
With: Kaan Cankat

Description: This project investigates the impact of municipal annexation on the provision of local public goods and the spatial sorting of populations. By analyzing case studies of annexation events, we aim to understand how changes in municipal boundaries affect the distribution of public resources and the demographic composition of affected areas.
